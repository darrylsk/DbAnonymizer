# DbAnonymizer
Copies a SQL Server database, replacing any identifying information with anonymous or random data.

Uses SQL Server Management Objects to create a replica of an existing database, including indexes, user-defined functions and foreign keys.  Other objects such as stored procedures and triggers are not included yet, but are planned and hopefully will follow soon.

### Read the App.config file for important instructions on first-time use.
