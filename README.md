# DbAnonymizer
Copies a SQL Server database, replacing any identifying information with anonymous or random data.

Uses SQL Server Management Objects to create a replica of an existing database, including indexes, user-defined functions and foreign keys.  Other objects such as stored procedures and triggers are not included yet, but are planned and hopefully will follow soon.

Pull requests are encouraged.  Please push your changes to a feature branch.
